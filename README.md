Kaggle Project- [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)

I am participating in this competition to enhance my programming skills along with knowledge. This is about House Price using Advanced Regression techniques such as Random Forest,
Gradient Boosting, etc. This also allows you to be creative about feature engineering.

So, I started off with cleaning the data (I used every methods for the knowledge purpose) and then exporting the data for processing. You can skip this if you want to clean the 
data in a lot simpler ways.
